Potential Errors
1.	If you don’t change the Style, the magazine won’t be consistent with the other documents on the page.
2.	If you don’t change the Size, the magazines on the WordPress page will push the other magazines to another line and will not feature all documents equally.
3.	If you don’t delete the hyperlink code, an added hyperlinked title will appear on the page. It cannot be manipulated.
